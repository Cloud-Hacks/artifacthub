install: |
  The *job-executor-service* can be installed as a part of [Keptn's uniform](https://keptn.sh).

  ### Deploy in your Kubernetes cluster

  To deploy the current version of the *job-executor-service* in your Keptn Kubernetes cluster, apply
  the [`deploy/service.yaml`](deploy/service.yaml) file:

  ```console
  kubectl apply -f deploy/service.yaml
  ```

  This should install the `job-executor-service` together with a Keptn `distributor` into the `keptn` namespace, which you
  can verify using

  ```console
  kubectl -n keptn get deployment job-executor-service -o wide
  kubectl -n keptn get pods -l run=job-executor-service
  ```

  ### Up- or Downgrading

  Adapt and use the following command in case you want to up- or downgrade your installed version (specified by
  the `$VERSION` placeholder):

  ```console
  kubectl -n keptn set image deployment/job-executor-service job-executor-service=keptnsandbox/job-executor-service:$VERSION --record
  ```

  ### Uninstall

  To delete a deployed *job-executor-service*, use the file `deploy/*.yaml` files from this repository and delete the
  Kubernetes resources:

  ```console
  kubectl delete -f deploy/service.yaml
  ```
