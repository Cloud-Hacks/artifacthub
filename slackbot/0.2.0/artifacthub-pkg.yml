  1. We are finished with this integration by now. However, we need to change some settings later, so pleae keep this browser open.

  1. Go to your Slack workspace and create a new channel that will receive the approval notifications. You can name it, e.g., **Keptn-approvals**.

  1. Add the app to the channel by clicking on **Add an app** and select the newly created app from the list.

  1. In the left menu of Slack right-click on the channel that you just created and click on **Copy link**. Open this link in a browser or paste it into a textfile as we will need the channel ID for the integration to work. 

  1. The link will look similar to *https://your-workspace.slack.com/archives/C018WDNTZKN* - please copy the last part of the URL after the last `/` as this is the channel ID that we'll need in a minute. In this example the channel ID is `C018WDNTZKN`.
