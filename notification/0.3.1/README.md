    ```yaml
    containers:
    - name: notification-service
        image: keptncontrib/notification-service:0.3.1
    ```

    value: ""
    - name: BRIDGE_URL
    value: ""
    - name: WEBEXTEAMS_URL
    value: ""
    ```
1. Deploy services into cluster
  * ```kubectl apply -f notification-service.yaml -n keptn``` using the file in this repo
1. Now run Keptn pipelines and watch for the notifications in your team channel
1. Validate cluster resources ```kubectl -n keptn get pods```.  You should see the pod running the service.

# Send notifications

Use the keptn CLI to start a pipeline using the command [keptn send event new-artifact](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.6.0/reference/cli/#keptn-send-event-new-artifact). As the pipeline runs,
it will send various cloud events like "configuration change" and "deployment finished".
